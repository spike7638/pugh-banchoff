Goal:
.Get draw_tri working
.Build a spherical complex and render it in colors
.Build a circular complex and render it in colors

Improve coloring scheme: colors for edges if they're top-dimensional. 

NOTES: 
complex: 
  dimension, 
  pointSet,
  simplices{1...dim}, 
  simplexCount(d),
  simplex(d, i)  [ith simplex of dimension d]
  vertex(i)
  edge(i)
  tri(i)
  tet(i)  [fails if complex dimension is, say, 2]
      
equivariantComplex
  complex based on equivariant (point?) set
  
equivariantSphereComplex
  complex based on equivariant sphere set
